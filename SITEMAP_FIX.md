# Sitemap Placeholder URL Fix

## Issue

The sitemap.xml generated by Strapi contains a placeholder/broken URL:
```
https://augmenter.dev/articles/article
```

This URL appears to be a placeholder article that was created during development or testing.

## Root Cause

The `strapi-5-sitemap-plugin` generates sitemap URLs based on actual content in the Strapi database. There is an article entry with the slug `"article"` that needs to be either:

1. **Deleted** (if it's truly a placeholder)
2. **Published with proper content** (if it's meant to be a real article)
3. **Excluded from sitemap** (via plugin configuration)

## Fix Options

### Option 1: Delete via Strapi Admin Panel (Recommended)

1. Log into Strapi admin panel at `https://strapi.oltre.dev/admin`
2. Navigate to **Content Manager** → **Articles**
3. Find the article with slug `"article"`
4. Delete or unpublish it
4. The sitemap will automatically regenerate

### Option 2: Add Exclusion Filter in Plugin Config

Add a filter to exclude specific slugs from the sitemap (requires plugin configuration in admin panel):

```json
{
  "contentTypes": [
    {
      "name": "api::article.article",
      "excludedSlugs": ["article"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Option 3: Direct Database Query

If admin access is not available, the article can be deleted directly:

```sql
-- Find the article with slug "article"
SELECT id, title, slug, published_at FROM articles WHERE slug = 'article';

-- Delete the placeholder article
DELETE FROM articles WHERE slug = 'article';
```

## Verification

After applying the fix, verify the sitemap no longer contains the placeholder:

```bash
curl -s https://augmenter.dev/sitemap.xml | grep "articles/article"
# Should return no results
```
